Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

Before You Begin

Create a new repository for this project called python-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your local git repository, create a directory for each Python Challenge. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: PyBank and  PyPoll.

Inside of each folder that you just created, add the following:

A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure your script has the correct path to the CSV file.
An "analysis" folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.

Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.
PyBank

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

Hints and Considerations

Consider what we've learned so far. To date, we've learned how to import modules like csv; to read and write files in various formats; to store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries; to iterate through basic data structures; and to debug along the way. Using what we've learned, try to break down your tasks into discrete mini-objectives. This will be a much better course of action than spending all your time looking for a solution on Stack Overflow.
As you will discover, for some of these challenges, the datasets are quite large. This was done purposefully, as it showcases one of the limits of Excel-based analysis. While our first instinct, as data analysts, is often to head straight into Excel, creating scripts in Python can provide us with more robust options for handling "big data".
Write one script for each dataset provided. Run your script separately to make sure that the code works for its respective dataset.
Feel encouraged to work in groups, but don't shortchange yourself by copying someone else's work. You get what you put in, and the art of programming is extremely unforgiving to moochers. Dig your heels in, burn the night oil, and learn this while you can! These are skills that will pay dividends in your future career.
Start early, and reach out for help often! Challenge yourself to identify specific questions for your instructors and TAs. Don't resign yourself to simply saying, "I'm totally lost." If you need help, reach out because we're happy to help. But, come prepared and show us what you have done and your thought process.
Always commit your work and back it up with GitHub/GitLab pushes. You don't want to lose hours of your work because you didn't push it to GitHub/GitLab every half hour or so.
Ensure your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file
